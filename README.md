- âš¡ Fun fact: I got into computers while i was a kid due to deleting my windows system files. My computer
  became unbootable but i was scared to tell my parents due to scolding, so i took it upon myself
  to fix this. then i installed and started using linux and tweaking some stuff and using bash.
